\section{Activities and tasks}

\par To implement \RCC{} with concurrent \PBFT{} instances in Nexres. Four modules are required: \emph{Client, 
Primary, Backup Replica, Total Ordering}. All modules consist of normal-case algorithms and recovery algorithms. 
The implementation of normal-case algorithms is of higher priority while the implementation of recovery algorithms 
is optional. Also, the evaluation that helps us assess \RCC{}'s performance is necessary.

\subsection{Configuration}

\par Using \PBFT{}, when starting service, servers in NexRes read a configuration file to learn the number of replicas 
and the original primary. To implement \RCC{}, we need to add the number of instances and corresponding primaries into 
the configuration file. 

\subsection{HeartBeat Message}

\par Using \PBFT{}, servers in NexRes inform clients of the current primary by sending \emph{HeartBeat} messages to 
clients. To implement \RCC{}, we need to add the number of instances and corresponding primaries into 
the \emph{HeartBeat} messages.

\subsection{Instance Indentification}

\par Running concurrent instances, replicas in \RCC{} should be able to identify the instance of each message. 
To implement this, we need to add a data field called \emph{instanceid} into the definition of message classes. With 
such a field, replicas can to map messages to correct corresponding instances.

\subsection{Total Ordering}

\par Before executing committed client transactions, \RCC{} orders the committed transactions between 
different instances.  We need to implement a mechanism to determine the execution order of committed transactions 
in one round. The simplest one would be ordering based on instance id, from low to high.

\subsection{Evaluation}

\par To evaluate the performance of \RCC{}, we will conduct the following experiments for \RCC{} and \PBFT{}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Best-case Throughput. Compare the \emph{best-case} throughput of \RCC{} and \PBFT{} of different scales.
    \item Throughput-Latency. Compare the best latency with the peak throughput of \RCC{} and \PBFT{} of different scales.
    \item Batching. Compare the \emph{best-case} throughput of \RCC{} and \PBFT{} of different batch sizes.
    \item Concurrency. Compare the \emph{best-case} throughput of \RCC{} of different instance numbers.
\end{enumerate}
