\subsection{Client}

\par Clients are the generators of transaction requests. In \RCC{}, the client $\Client{}$ has the following activities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a batch of client transactions $T$ and send the batch to a preferred replica $\Replica{}$. 
    \item Set a timer $t_T$ after sending $T$ to $\Replica{}$.
    \item Wait for responses from $\f+1$ distinct replicas that claim to have comitted $T$.
\end{enumerate}
