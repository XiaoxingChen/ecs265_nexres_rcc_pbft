\section{Problem Statement}
\par With the flourishing of permissioned blockchain which typically adopts the primary-backup scheme, 
the concerns about throughput limitations have been increasingly growing. To relieve this concern, the Resilient 
Concurrent Consensus paradigm (\RCC{}) \cite{rcc} has been presented to turn any primary-backup consensus protocol into concurrent 
consensus by running multiple instances concurrently. \RCC{} is designed with performance in mind and ensures increased 
resilience against failures. Nexres, as the next generation of ResilientDB \cite{gupta2020resilientdb, rahnama2020scalable}, which saturates 
the primary node's network bandwidth in \PBFT{} \cite{pbft}, meets the prerequisites for leveraging \RCC{} to optimize its performance 
and throughput. Our goal for the final project is to implement \RCC{} with concurrent \PBFT{} instances in Nexres, compare 
the results and performance with \PBFT{}, and make further optimizations.
