\section{Problem Statement}
\par With the flourishing of consensus-based database systems which typically adopt the primary-backup scheme, 
the concerns about throughput limitations have increasingly grown. To relieve this concern, the Resilient 
Concurrent Consensus paradigm has been presented to turn the primary-backup consensus protocol into concurrent 
consensus by running many instances concurrently. \RCC{} is designed with performance in mind and ensures increased 
resilience against failures. Nexres, as the next generation of ResilientDB, which achieves the max limit of 
the master node network bandwidth in \PBFT{}, meets the prerequisites for leveraging \RCC{} to optimize its performance 
and throughput. Our goal for the final project is to implement \RCC{} with concurrent \PBFT{} instances in Nexres, compare 
the results and performance with \PBFT{}, and optimize potential drawbacks.
