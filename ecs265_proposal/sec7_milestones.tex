    \item Independent test of each individual module (work in progress).
    \item Modules integration and basic features test.
    \item Experiments for comparison with \PBFT{} (throughput, latency, batching).
    \item Experiments for the performance of \RCC{} with different concurrent instance numbers, investigating the benefits of concurrent consensus.
    \item Optimization.
    \item Test under single crash failure.
