\section{Associated risks}
The performance bottleneck of Resilient Concurrent Consensus includes not only the 
network bandwidth but also the CPU computational resource. 
This could be misleading while evaluating the performance. 
Developer should be careful while analyzing the performance of \RCC{}.
Besides, independent test of each individual modules should be 
well designed. Otherwise risks will be introduced in integration phase.
