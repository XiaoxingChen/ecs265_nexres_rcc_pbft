\section{Associated risks}
The performance bottleneck of Resilient Concurrent Consensus includes not only the 
network bandwidth but also the CPU computational resource. 
This could be misleading while evaluating the performance. 
The developer should be careful while analyzing the performance of \RCC{}.
Besides, independent tests of each individual module should be 
well designed. Otherwise, risks will be introduced in the integration phase.
